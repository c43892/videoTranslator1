# Configuration for VideoTranslator
# This file contains default settings for all processing steps

# Step 3: Transcription Configuration
transcription:
  # Transcription engine (currently only "whisper" is supported)
  engine: "whisper"
  
  # Whisper-specific settings
  whisper:
    # Model size: tiny, base, small, medium, large, large-v2, large-v3
    # Larger models are more accurate but slower and use more memory
    # tiny   - ~1GB VRAM, fastest
    # base   - ~1GB VRAM, good balance
    # small  - ~2GB VRAM, better accuracy
    # medium - ~5GB VRAM, high accuracy
    # large  - ~10GB VRAM, best accuracy
    model: "base"
    
    # Device: auto, cpu, cuda
    # auto - automatically detect GPU and use if available
    # cpu  - force CPU usage (slower but works everywhere)
    # cuda - force GPU usage (requires NVIDIA GPU with CUDA)
    device: "auto"
    
    # Language code for transcription (null for auto-detection)
    # Examples: "en", "zh", "ja", "es", "fr", "de", "ko"
    # null means Whisper will detect the language automatically
    language: null
    
    # Task: transcribe or translate
    # transcribe - transcribe in original language
    # translate  - transcribe and translate to English (Whisper built-in)
    # Note: For VideoTranslator, always use "transcribe" 
    # Translation happens in Step 4
    task: "transcribe"
    
    # Enable word-level timestamps for more precise timing
    word_timestamps: true
    
    # Verbose output during transcription
    verbose: false
  
  # Non-dialogue event detection settings
  non_dialogue:
    # Enable detection of non-speech events (laughing, crying, etc.)
    detect: true
    
    # Confidence threshold for valid speech (0.0 to 1.0)
    # Segments with lower confidence may be marked as non-dialogue
    confidence_threshold: 0.7
    
    # Custom markers for different event types
    # These will be used in the SRT output
    markers:
      laughing: "[[ laughing ]]"
      crying: "[[ crying ]]"
      breathing: "[[ breathing ]]"
      panting: "[[ panting ]]"
      sighing: "[[ sighing ]]"
      coughing: "[[ coughing ]]"
      screaming: "[[ screaming ]]"
      gasping: "[[ gasping ]]"
      music: "[[ music ]]"
      applause: "[[ applause ]]"
      inaudible: "[[ inaudible ]]"
      silence: "[[ silence ]]"
  
  # SRT output formatting
  output:
    # Maximum characters per line for readability
    max_chars_per_line: 42
    
    # Maximum lines per subtitle entry (typically 1-2)
    max_lines_per_subtitle: 2
    
    # Minimum subtitle duration in seconds
    min_duration: 0.5
    
    # Maximum subtitle duration in seconds
    max_duration: 7.0
    
    # Encoding for SRT file
    encoding: "utf-8"

# General settings
general:
  # Working directory for temporary files
  temp_dir: "temp"
  
  # Keep intermediate files after processing
  keep_intermediate: true
  
  # Number of worker threads for parallel processing
  num_workers: 1
  
  # Logging level: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
  log_level: "INFO"
